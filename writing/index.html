david bowie was a rattan chair that was recycled in 1898 before experiencing an unspecified number of lives as single-celled and basic-multicellular organisms over the course of the next 3 years. the final of these organisms had achieved a symbiotic relationship with another cell that parasitized it. the pair only reproduced a few times before dying and its lineage ended quickly but scietists estimate that it would have become a cellular apex predator that would have demolished all cellular ecologies it sprerd to, leading to the eventual evolutiin of the planets most hardy and successful line of animal, eventually replacing humans as the most dominant species in a time as small as 150,000 years. after that he was a fly that died when a horse pooped onto it while it was eating some of the horsesshit already on the ground

		It is the belief of many a wizard that antimagic is simply a form of magic itself, and that its adherents are would-be-wizards blinded by belief. I almost cannot blame them, what with the number of warlocks and unchivalrous knights who learn the ways of wand and tome to enhance their combat prowess and, specifically, render more traditional combat magics ineffective against them.
		<br>

Systems of magic do not concern themselves with nonbelievers, as the power of the spell is in the mind of the mage, so surely, something that is its opposite must still participate in that unreality, that uncertain realm of the spellcaster.
		<br>

But no, antimagic is not a form of magic. It is not an ability wielded on the battlefield. In fact, most antimagic action is done with pen and paper, printing press and speech. We antimages understand that magic exists in the realm of belief, and as such, aim to destroy that belief in every way we can. We study magic so that we may disprove it. We create strong, rigorous systems of logic that the world may be viewed through that leaves no room for its existence. We create reproducible results. We create an objective reality where there is no uncertainty that the mage may exploit.
		<br>

Yes, in battle we do deploy antimagic techniques, but these techniques are extensions of our ideology. Crush the wizards' windpipes, remove their fingers, burn their personal tomes, employ psychological manipulations and tortures to erode their willpower.
		<br>

Turn their neighbors against them, turn their friends against them, turn them against themselves. Terraform the environment around them to be rigid and predictable. Make them work, and distract them in their downtime. Eventually you get into their heads. They begin to fight their own beliefs. Even if you don't entirely convert them, they're left in no state to teach others.
		<br>

Antimagic is simple. Antimagic is logical. Antimagic is inevitable. Join us, and understand.

The question? The prompt? Oh, my, oh no. Oh do I really have to? Does it really have to end? Well, okay.<br>
My one post? I think it would go something like this:<br>
When I was a young child, right before bed, I would line all my plushies up on my bed, all facing me. And we would pray together. We would pray to a god that I would lose faith in at an early age once I realized that my sadness would never cease. I don't think any of us realized what exactly we were dabbling with. Long after that god died, my plushies remained alive. I made sure none were left alone under the bed, none were turned over on their faces. I still feel the love in these things. I've become one of them. We lay in piles together and sleep, serene and smiling. Well, we being my current pals. My old plushies, the ones imbued with that force of prayers made by a desperate child, I cannot find. I've dug through every box in my parents' place. I've found my brothers old toys and plushies. I've even found my dad's ancient plushie, safely stored away and surviving through time. But I cannot find them. I've asked, of course, but I know where my parents think they are is wrong. Because I've already privately snooped there. Sometimes I cry when I think about them. There's no punchline. No moral. Just a glimpse into a sadness of mine.

<br>
Look, pal, you have cocked up here. I mean MAJOR cockup. Full-on cockjob. When I recover from this stun it’s over for you. Just you wait. When your incredibly long stun (which you generated with the high stun rating of your mace plus multiplicative bonii from your build) wears off you are DONE. FINISHED. I am going to go Spell CRAZY on your extremely armored and insulated ass. I am going to [Ball Lightning] your shit so hard.

		Do you think they make any fun lobotomies<br>
Lobotomies for fun<br>
Casual/recreational lobotomy<br>
<br>
Got to my local lobotomer and tell them I just want a little off the top<br>
Lobotomer I want a look that says "I'm not here right now"<br>
<br>
I want to truly see the back of my eyelids<br>
Do they have designer lobotomies<br>
<br>
Are there lobotomies that I could never afford<br>
<br>
Supreme lobotomy is hype beast shit not worth the price imo<br>
Gotta go with one of those lobotomy brands that uses genuine materials and hand craftsmanship<br>
<br>
I was struck by an errant gamma ray as a child<br>
It pierced completely uninteresting grey matter<br>
But it gave me a hunger for the real thing<br>
<br>
I was given a very tiny lobotomy as a child by government agents in the hopes that it would destroy the part of my brain that wanted lobotomies<br>
<br>
They forgot that holes are inherently objects of desire<br>
<br>
In quantum physics a Hole is a disruption in a field where there is a vacuum that behaves in ways that mirror the ways a particle acts<br>
A Lack Of Thing in the Perfect Shape of a Thing<br>
<br>
My brain has so many little holes in it<br>
Each one thrumming with desire<br>
Interacting with the neuron fields around them<br>
<br>
You know if you make a hole in a net, you actually reduce the total number of holes<br>
<br>
I need some fun lobotomies that can make giant holes in this moth-eaten cloth that resides within my skull<br>
<br>
||: a circle inside :||<br>
<br>
endlessly<br>
<br>
Like the rings of a tree trunk<br>
A circle inside a circle inside a circle<br>
All that changes is that the tree gets older<br>
Growing the same circles over and over<br>
All I can do are these damn circles and get older<br>
<br>
Need a nice juicy lobotomy to completely upset the current circuit<br>
<br>
A hole where a hole should be<br>
A hole wanting to be filled by a hole<br>
<br>
Off topic I wonder if they do lobotomy for dogs
