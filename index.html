                    <p>In typical Nines fashion; new year, new website.     
                        But! In atypical Nines fashion, the new website is the same website! Wowee!
                        Why? Well, it looks cool. And more importantly, the new site will be more web-art like its sites of yore.
                        The time for exclusive focus on photography is over.
                        Please, explore this website, Nines has made a lot of art over the years, and it needs to live inside of your mind to reproduce!
                    </p>
                    <p>COMING SOON: blog atom feed, better photo albums, writing a static site generator so I don't need to update all this shit by hand (hopefully leading to frequent site updates)</p>
