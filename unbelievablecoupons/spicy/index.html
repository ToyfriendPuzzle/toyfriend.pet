		WALT DISNEY'S SEVERED HEAD
	</h2>
	<h3>cw: sexual content, bigotry</h3>
	<br>
	<p>
	It's 2022 and Walt Disney's Severed Head has gotten a taste for tr***y cock and no one's exactly sure how.
    	</p>
	<p>
	Yes, the Frozen Head urban legend is true. It should have been obvious that it was true. Disney: obsessed with futurism, possessed with endless money, beset by lung cancer, all at a time when cryonics was leaping off the pages of a crackpot book into the minds of crackpot refrigerator salesmen everywhere. Chop off the diseased meat, preserve the goods, and pray to future science. It's a match made in heaven. Or some kind of icy purgatory anyway. 
	</p>
	<p>
	The Head was reanimated on 9/11<sup>[1]</sup>, but remains confined to Its bunker to this very day. It was given internet access within its first few weeks of resurrection, which kept it updated and entertained up until the advent of social media. Within a few months of Facebook existing, It was banned enough times to where It logged off for the last time over a decade ago<sup>[2]</sup>. It exclusively stays up-to-date with the outside world through 16 hours of television a day, 10.5 of which are spent on advertisements. It has no contact with any outsiders other than The Minions who keep the Head Alive machines running, and they don't dare utter more than empty pleasantries in The Head's presence<sup>[3]</sup>.
	</p>
	<p>
	Even if any Minions were to converse with It on topics of sexuality, only one of them knows anything more about trans people than what the news scaremongervomits on slow days. This Minion regularly thinks "lalalalalala" in its mind when near The Head out of fear that The Head can maybe read its thoughts and figure out that it shamefully jerks off to trans porn while shitting in the work bathroom every day, at 7:00AM sharp<sup>[4]</sup>. This of course, is a load of paranoid crap inspired by too many science fiction films, or whatever.
	</p>
	<p>
	Ultimately, it doesn't matter why The Head wants what It wants, what matters is that It gets what It wants<sup>[5]</sup>... Which is a particularly complex task this time around. Can't exactly cover the town in ads proclaiming "Disney wants Trans Actors!" without bringing corporate down into The Bunker and that's just not fun for anyone involved<sup>[6]</sup>. Anyway, none of The Minions even knew what exactly a "trans woman" was other than some kind of perverted cross-dresser. How would they even find such a bottom-feeding sicko? The news said they lurk in the shadows among normal folk. Your friends, your neighbors, anyone, could be a "trans" in disguise. They speculated for days without coming any closer to a plan to get The Head its meal.
	</p>
	<p>
	On a particularly slow day of "planning", The Minions debated over what the assigned-at-birth gender was even supposed to be for a "trans woman". This went on for hours until That Minion snapped and informed them all about cocks, hormones, autogynophilia, and every other buzzword that if listed here would reduce your mind to dust. The other Minions promptly called This Minion a fa***t, and told it to come back with some trans cock for The Head, or to not come back at all. Problem solved.
	</p>
	<hr>
	<p>
	1. (The Head's Minions honestly believed it was the start of World War III and flipped the switch early. Apparently they didn't get the memo.)
	</p>
	<p>
	2. (Walt Disney was, and His Severed Head is; so racist and bigoted that, yes, even Facebook and Twitter had to kick him off their platforms.)
	</p>
	<p>
	3. (Despite The Minions consisting of a team of highly-educated racists, their talks with The Head remain awkward and brief, as It operates on that blunt, lead-fuelled, '60s racism that you just don't find coming out of any old talking head these days.)
	</p>
	<p>
	4. (Schedule:
	<br>
	4:00AM - Wake up in The Bunker, drink 1 mug of coffee, shower.
	<br>
	4:30AM - Drink 1 mug of coffee, scream.
	<br>
	5:00AM - Walk into decontamination chamber, try not to fall asleep<sup>[a]</sup>.
	<br>
	5:30AM - Walk out of decontamination chamber, put on antibacterial scrubs, drink 1 mug of decontaminated coffee.
	<br>
	5:45AM - Pretend to inspect all the pipes attached to the Head Alive machines while dozing off just a little.
	<br>
	6:00AM - Drink 1 mug of decontaminated coffee, begin lotioning The Head's neck stitches while ignoring Its moans.
	<br>
	6:30AM - Drink 1 mug of decontaminated coffee, begin lubricating The Head's lips with spit, ignoring Its protests about coffee-flavored spit.
	<br>
	7:00AM - Bowels start gurgling, immediately reach half-chub and head to the bathroom.)
	</p>
	<p>
	5. (In a rather convoluted series of copyright and ownership laws, loopholes, and various other legal magicks, Walt Disney's Severed Head technically still controls the Disney corporation, but cannot actually weigh in on any business decisions as It no longer owns any stock, or whatever. It can still threaten to reveal Itself to the world and probably completely tank the company's profits for a quarter though, and this is threat enough for It to unconditionally get Its way.)
	</p>
	<p>
	6. (The last time Corporate had to intervene with Head Business was when It was given a remote-controlled drone through which It could experience the outside world and, more importantly, stop asking for Minions to listen to It spew Its takes about the day's news<sup>[b]</sup>. The plan went smoothly for all of 36 hours before the drone was found in Disney offices ranting about. Well. You can probably guess what. It took a whole team of animators, writers, lawyers, and various middle-managers 13 days to reassure The Head that the Disney Corporation was still racist, just in a more Modern way.)
	</p>
	<hr class="dot">
	<p>
	a. (Last guy to fall asleep in the decontamination chamber was decontaminated to death. Ironically, the decontamination chamber is incredibly hard to clean. The Head almost perished in the time it took to get a new one set-up while everyone was scratching their heads at what to do with the old one.<sup>[I]</sup>)
	</p>
	<p>
	b. (Of which there were many, due to the whole 16 hours of television a day thing. Some Minions reported walking away from these sessions more racist than when they started, which is really saying something considering some of them are ex-lawmakers.)
	</p>
	<hr class="dot">
	<p>
	I. (The old decontamination chamber is now a sleeping quarters. It's part of the hazing ritual to make new hires sleep in the same room that other guy died in while sleeping.)
