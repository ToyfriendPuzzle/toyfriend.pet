                    <h1>WHAT'S NINES BEEN UP TO?</h1>
                    <p>We're finally un-sicking! Still haven't heard back about my camera yet x . x, gonna inquire about progress in the next few days. Been a time of broken sleep schedules and lots of laying around...</p>
                    <p>We watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIgE23LHgPQ">the animation for Terry Pratchet's Soul Music</a>! While it hasn't aged perfectly (oh god the guru near the start), it has similar aesthetic qualities and much of the charm of old <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcDQN2OElSw">CD-i animations</a></p>
                    <p>I've been tinkering with <a href="https://endeavouros.com/">my OS</a>, trying to learn how to decorate it to my tastes. This has led to me messing around with some TUI programs because I think they look Neat and I like that they all use my terminal's theming. Right now, I'm writing this blog post using <a href="https://kakoune.org/">Kakoune</a>, which is very complicated, but I feel like a cyborg when I actually remember the hotkeys and use them to do stuff that saves me time.</p>
                    <p>I have some ideas for projects, I think I'll put in some work on a photography cheat-sheet zine that'll go up somewhere on here, and I have a really silly and complicated idea for a new photo gallery layout.</p>
                    <p>Okay that's all bye</p>

                    <h1>I'M WRITING SOMETHIN</h1>
                    <p>Today my creature got sick with the sick that I just got better from that I got from its housemate after she got better from it. Ah, the cycle of life. Anyway, I had an idea for a story while lazing about,</p>

                    <p>It snowed a light dusting today, and we've been watching lots of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Defunctland/videos">Defunctland documentaries</a>. I've only left the house for cans of soup and snacks. Let's hope it recovers in time to see pepole this weekend!</p>

                    <h1>MR. BEAST DESTROYS BELOVED CAMERA</h1>
                    <p>I wish this was a joke, I wish that my beloved and beat-up Nikon Df had not died under the soul-less gaze of Mr. Beast's half-smiling face<sup id="#20250101s1"><a href="#20250101f1">1</a></sup>, yet here we are...</p>
                    <img src="../files/photos/9DF_9592_thumb.jpg" alt="A black&white fisheye photograph of a figure standing next to a cardboard cutout of Mr. Beast." title="A black&white fisheye photograph of a figure standing next to a cardboard cutout of Mr. Beast."/>
                    <p>The above photograph is the final one taken by my beloved photosmachine. It has not once shown a hickup in its function, has never had any issues, any weirdness, nothin'. I'm walking around, I see a Mr. Beast cutout, I tell my creature to pose with it, I take the shot. Eh, not enough dread, recompose the shot, press the shutter release again, then- BAM- -Err- displayed on the screen. Mirror slaps on pressing the shutter release, but the shutter does not open. The camera is currently sitting in a local camera repair shop with an uncertain fate. It may or may not be fixable. If it's not fixable, I'm fucked. I cannot afford a new one. Mr. Beast, if you're out there somewhere, please buy me a new camera.</p>
                    <p><sup id="#20250101f1"><a href="#20250101s1">1</a></sup> Mr. Beast only smiles with his mouth. If you cover that billion-dollar smile, you can clearly see an emptiness in those million-dollar eyes.</p>

                    <p>In typical Nines fashion; new year, new website.     
                        But! In atypical Nines fashion, the new website is the same website! Wowee!
                        Why? Well, it looks cool. And more importantly, the new site will be more web-art like its sites of yore.
                        The time for exclusive focus on photography is over.
                        Please, explore this website, Nines has made a lot of art over the years, and it needs to live inside of your mind to reproduce!
                    </p>
                    <p>COMING SOON: blog atom feed, better photo albums, writing a static site generator so I don't need to update all this shit by hand (hopefully leading to frequent site updates)</p>
