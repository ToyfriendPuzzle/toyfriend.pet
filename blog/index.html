                    <h1>What's it been up to, huh?</h1>
                    <p>Yeah I've been lazing about updating the site... but that just means I have more to share!</p>
                    <p>Uh... I guess a whole lot and a lotta little has happened so far this year? I got into some new artistic mediums. Scanography, sculpture(?), and painting. (I'll start putting galleries on this site... EVENTUALLY!).</p>
                    <p>My Nikon Df came back from the shop after months still broken, dealing with having no Good camera (no offense to my digicams...) from December to May sucked a lot. Getting into the above mentioned mediums in that time was a silver lining. I picked up a Pentax APS-C DSLR to replace it (on the off-chance that the Df can be resurrected it'll be something different). The new camera is pretty snazzy, but I do find myself missing good ol manual focus on a through a good focusing screen.</p>
                    <p>If you're interested in seeing my photo experiments and/or do photography yourself, please check out the <a href="https://streak.club/s/1778/daily-photo-club">daily photo club</a>!</p>
                    <p>Oh, yeah, also my friends and I started a newspaper! We need submissions! And readers! Go to <a href="https://bigolnews.org/">bigolnews.org</a> to learn more!</p>
                    <p>I've also been jamming and performing music a lot more. Yet another thing I need to throw onto this site. Bwahhhh. It'll happen. It'll happen.</p>
                    <p>I think that's it for this update. I'm not gonna say anything like "I hope the next update doesn't take as long." because I could see that getting really funny if the next update is like near the end of the year. So I will just say: until next time! May your life be weird!</p>

                    <h1>YAY WEBSITE UPDATE</h1>
                    <p>Some changes and additions...</p>
                    <p>There is now a <href="/music/>music page</a> for my music! It's not complete yet but now there's a proper home for it on the web. Woah!</p>
                    <p>I've also changed up the layout and navigation of the site, there's now a directory on all the (currently updated) pages! Yay!</p>
                    <p>I'd been meaning to make these changes for literally weeks but I've been struggling with low energy, headaches, and general unmotivation. It seems like I'm coming out the other side of it finally so hopefully more art goodies soon to come!</p>
                    <p>Not the biggest update for weeks of nothing, but hey, it's what I can manage.</p>
                    <p>A real nice thing about having a personal website is that there isn't really any time pressure on anything. People very rarely if ever visit websites, so it's more of a slow-building collection of everything me, and once it's up on here, it's up on here. It's kinda meditative, at least when my executive function actually allows me to work on it.</p>

                    <h1>GREAT NEWS</h1>
                    <p>IT'S NOT A SMOLDERING PILE OF ASH! IT LIVES!</p>
                    <p>The Df will live!</p>
                    <p>Adrian texted me back! The culprit is likely damaged shutter blades, not a dead shutter!!! I won't be in financial ruin! I'll just be out a DSLR for a time until the repair is done and I can either come back to Windsor to retrieve it, or get it shipped back home!</p>
                    <p>So, in the meantime I'll keep working on nonphoto art until I'm home this weekend, then it's LX3 snapping until the Resurrection!</p>

                    <h1>WHAT'S NINES BEEN UP TO?</h1>
                    <p>We're finally un-sicking! Still haven't heard back about my camera yet x . x, gonna inquire about progress in the next few days. Been a time of broken sleep schedules and lots of laying around...</p>
                    <p>We watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIgE23LHgPQ">the animation for Terry Pratchet's Soul Music</a>! While it hasn't aged perfectly (oh god the guru near the start), it has similar aesthetic qualities and much of the charm of old <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcDQN2OElSw">CD-i animations</a></p>
                    <p>I've been tinkering with <a href="https://endeavouros.com/">my OS</a>, trying to learn how to decorate it to my tastes. This has led to me messing around with some TUI programs because I think they look Neat and I like that they all use my terminal's theming. Right now, I'm writing this blog post using <a href="https://kakoune.org/">Kakoune</a>, which is very complicated, but I feel like a cyborg when I actually remember the hotkeys and use them to do stuff that saves me time.</p>
                    <p>I have some ideas for projects, I think I'll put in some work on a photography cheat-sheet zine that'll go up somewhere on here, and I have a really silly and complicated idea for a new photo gallery layout.</p>
                    <p>Okay that's all bye</p>

                    <p>Today my creature got sick with the sick that I just got better from that I got from its housemate after she got better from it. Ah, the cycle of life. Anyway, I had an idea for a story while lazing about,</p>

                    <p>It snowed a light dusting today, and we've been watching lots of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Defunctland/videos">Defunctland documentaries</a>. I've only left the house for cans of soup and snacks. Let's hope it recovers in time to see pepole this weekend!</p>

                    <h1>MR. BEAST DESTROYS BELOVED CAMERA</h1>
                    <p>I wish this was a joke, I wish that my beloved and beat-up Nikon Df had not died under the soul-less gaze of Mr. Beast's half-smiling face<sup id="#20250101s1"><a href="#20250101f1">1</a></sup>, yet here we are...</p>
                    <img src="../files/photos/9DF_9592_thumb.jpg" alt="A black&white fisheye photograph of a figure standing next to a cardboard cutout of Mr. Beast." title="A black&white fisheye photograph of a figure standing next to a cardboard cutout of Mr. Beast."/>
                    <p>The above photograph is the final one taken by my beloved photosmachine. It has not once shown a hickup in its function, has never had any issues, any weirdness, nothin'. I'm walking around, I see a Mr. Beast cutout, I tell my creature to pose with it, I take the shot. Eh, not enough dread, recompose the shot, press the shutter release again, then- BAM- -Err- displayed on the screen. Mirror slaps on pressing the shutter release, but the shutter does not open. The camera is currently sitting in a local camera repair shop with an uncertain fate. It may or may not be fixable. If it's not fixable, I'm fucked. I cannot afford a new one. Mr. Beast, if you're out there somewhere, please buy me a new camera.</p>
                    <p><sup id="#20250101f1"><a href="#20250101s1">1</a></sup> Mr. Beast only smiles with his mouth. If you cover that billion-dollar smile, you can clearly see an emptiness in those million-dollar eyes.</p>

                    <p>In typical Nines fashion; new year, new website.     
                        But! In atypical Nines fashion, the new website is the same website! Wowee!
                        Why? Well, it looks cool. And more importantly, the new site will be more web-art like its sites of yore.
                        The time for exclusive focus on photography is over.
                        Please, explore this website, Nines has made a lot of art over the years, and it needs to live inside of your mind to reproduce!
                    </p>
                    <p>COMING SOON: blog atom feed, better photo albums, writing a static site generator so I don't need to update all this shit by hand (hopefully leading to frequent site updates)</p>
